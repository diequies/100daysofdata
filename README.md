# **My 1<sup>st</sup> #100DaysOfData Challenge**
In this repository I will track my first challenge of #100daysofdata, using as a summary of my activities, the books I read, the courses I take and the projects I make.

### **Day 1 of #100DaysOfData Challenge**

**Challenge Presentation**: I am starting a repository to track my first #100DaysOfData challenge. Currently I am looking to have change in my career from Mechanical Engineer to Data Scientist. So far, I have taken several course, read books and tried exercises and the famous [Titanic Competition](https://github.com/diequies/Titanic_Kaggle) from Kaggle. But from now and for the next 100 days I will start recording all the work I do to achieve my objective of becoming a Data Scientist.

I will stablish some rules to follow this challenge to make sure I can have the best output:
1. To do something related to Data Science every single day. As a minimum read some pages of a book, an article, whatever but something.
2. To keep record of everything I do, in this way I can go back to check what I have done and review my performance or effectivenes. Also it would be very useful if someone arrives to this repository as a summary of resources.
3. Try to keep always activated the three main items, a project, a book/paper and a course or certification.

To start the challenge I am currently having the next activities on-going:
1. **Project**: [**Zoopla London Houses Price Prediction from Scratch**](https://github.com/diequies/zoopla_houses). Where I am trying to perform as a main objective a price prediction on London Houses prices with information scrapped from Zoopla. As a side aims I want to add as much information as I can from several sources, like crime indexes, distances to tube, etc. and produce some clustering output.
2. **Course**: [**2021 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science**](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/). I have find really good critiques about this Udemy course and I am taking it as a review and to settle my current knowledge in Python and Data Science tools. I have already started the course and I am now going through Pandas module.
