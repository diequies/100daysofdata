# **My 1<sup>st</sup> #100DaysOfData Challenge**
In this repository I will track my first challenge of #100daysofdata, using as a summary of my activities, the books I read, the courses I take and the projects I make.

### **Day 1 of #100DaysOfData Challenge**

**Challenge Presentation**: I am starting a repository to track my first #100DaysOfData challenge. Currently, I am looking to have a change in my career from Mechanical Engineer to Data Scientist. So far, I have taken several courses, read books and tried exercises and the famous [Titanic Competition](https://github.com/diequies/Titanic_Kaggle) from Kaggle. But from now and for the next 100 days, I will start recording all the work I do to become a Data Scientist.

I will establish some rules to follow this challenge to make sure I can have the best output:
1. To do something related to Data Science every single day. As a minimum, read some pages of a book, an article, whatever but something.
2. To keep a record of everything I do, then I can go back to check what I have done and review my performance or effectiveness. Also, it would be beneficial if someone arrives at this repository as a summary of resources.
3. Try always to keep activated the three main items, a project, a book/paper and a course or certification.

To start the challenge, I currently have the following activities ongoing:
1. **Project**: [Zoopla London Houses Price Prediction from Scratch](https://github.com/diequies/zoopla_houses). Where I am trying to perform as a primary objective a price prediction on London Houses prices with information scrapped from Zoopla. As a side aim, I want to add as much information as possible from several sources, like crime indexes, distances to tube, etc. and produce some clustering output.
2. **Course**: [2021 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/). I have found excellent critiques about this Udemy course. Therefore I am taking it as a review and to settle my current knowledge in Python and Data Science tools. I have already started the course and going through the Pandas module at the moment.
3. **Book**: [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/): I haven't started yet to read it, but it seems a good book to, again, settle the knowledge of Python and Data Science I have learnt so far. Also it will be helpful as a reference book.
